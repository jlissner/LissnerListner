          <Typography variant='h6' paragraph>On the Subject of Gravy</Typography>

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1" component="div">
            Some time ago Amy O'Brien commented that her girls have observed that some of the recipes assume one is
            already experienced in the kitchen and that it is not always clear what one should be doing or how one
            gets from here to there. And, it is occurred to me that one of life's greatest joys has been omitted
            from this cookbook: GRAVY! Perhaps we just take it for granted that everyone knows how to make it! Yet
            no one should go into adulthood without knowing how to make gravy. It just wouldn't be right!
          </Typography>

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1" component="div">
            So, I shall attempt to explain the way I make it. I would imagine that there are so many ways to make
            good gravy as there are cooks. So, this is just one way, which I learned at my Mother's knee.
          </Typography>

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1" component="div">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Assume you have been roasting some meat or fowl. When it is finished baking, remove it from the
                baking pan. In the bottom of the pan will be the meat juices and some grease. You want to leave
                the juices (flavor!) in the pan but remove all but 2-4 tablespoons of the grease. Starting with a
                tablespoon or two of flour add it to the pan and add a cup or so of water. Whisk or stir the mixture
                until well blended. As it cooks the mixture will thicken. Add more water and continue stirring.
                Bring the mixture to a boil and keep stirring. Add more water until you have the consistency you wish
                to have. Add salt to taste.
              </li>
              <li>
                Note: If you have been boiling potatoes save the potato water and use it instead of plain water. It
                will give you better flavor and you are not losing the potato vitamins!
              </li>
              <li>
                Note again: Gravy will taste of flour unless it is cooked well into the mixture. So be sure to gently
                boil your gravy for at least 2 minutes.
