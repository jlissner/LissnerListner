            Dear Family,
          </Typography>

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
            For the past 5 years or so Ellie and I have been working on a website for the family, <a href="https://lissner.io" className={classes.link}>lissner.io</a>. Today, I am happy to announce that the <strong>Family Cookbook</strong> portion of the website has been released! Connie released the latest edition of the family cookbook 21 years ago (find the recipe for Addie's Bourbon Slush to celebrate), then 4 years ago Patrick created a digital version of it which allowed many my generation to get their own version of it for the first time. Since then, everyone's version has different recipes with different notes. For people like my mom, the Colorado edition has different recipes in it than the Missouri one which is still different from the Florida one. Each and every cookbook has notes scrawled around and recipes stuffed in them.

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
            It may take some time to get used to the new format, but I hope that the search and filters will provide some help. Additionally, there are some new fields added to make it easier for our ever-growing user base in order to help people with dietary restrictions. I hope each and everyone who has recipes that they love will contribute and add those recipes!

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
            Just like all Family Cookbooks, this one is not perfect. Every recipe had to be manually entered, so if there is a typo or mistake, please let me know! The good news is only one person has to identify the mistake for ALL users to get the fix :). As each recipe had to be entered in a normalized fashion, some of the recipes have been purposefully changed, but I tried to keep the verbiage as close to the original as possible. Ellie and I had also spotted some errors in certain recipes, and I added what I believe to be the correct measurements in those places.

            While the family website is launching with only a Cookbook, this will be a project that continues to grow. There are lots of features that I want to create eventually, including but not limited to: family archives, Lissner list, picture sharing, document backups, family tree, and more!

            In order to access the site, you will need to send me an email FROM THE EMAIL YOU WANT TO LOG IN WITH. I will then create your account and send you your temporary credentials.

            Dear Family Members,
          </Typography>

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
            It's been 15 years since we first began collecting our favorite recipes and sharing them with each other. It began in the Scott family in the summer of '83 when Mary Kay and Bobbi were both getting married. (Did we think they needed help with their cooking?) Over time it has expanded to include the Lissner families. Because so many of us have enjoyed using the cookbook we have continued to save our best new recipes and include them every few years.

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
            Our recipe collection outgrew the little notebooks we kept them in, so 2 years ago it seemed to me to be a good time to "re-do" the whole thing and move to a bigger binder. Also, this would give me a chance to clarify some recipes, to attempt to correct the poor spelling (thank you Spellchecker!) and terrible typos as they were more and more embarrassing me. Finally, the next generation in the family have grown up and wanted a copy and there were no more. So, the time was right and I had a shiny new computer with which to work. Never mind that I was computer illiterate! So I dragged my feet and fretted and wondered how I would ever go about it. But finally, my new niece, Gina Schurman came along and said she would help me get started and show me a few basic tricks. That was the trigger I needed and have been having a wonderful experience putting this new updated version of our book together.

            It won't be as comfortable at first as the old book because, for one thing, all the pages will be clean! (I'm including a plastic sheet protector, which you can slip over the page you are currently using, to KEEP THOSE PAGES CLEAN!) Also, the format is different and recipes aren't where they used to be. I have tried to group similar subjects together to make it easier to find what you want. There is now a Table of Contents, which was badly needed in the old book. Now I realize how much more helpful it would have been to create an Index. Oh Well! But I do hope it will be fun to use, that you will find new favorites and enjoy seeing the old ones again.

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
            Let's keep on collecting really good recipes and sharing them with each other. Send them to me, if you wish, and I'll keep a file and "update" from time to time.

          <Typography paragraph variant="body1">
            I hope each of you will enjoy the new book!

            <ul>
              <li>Although I have tried to make the recipes pretty clear, always read through the whole recipe so there are no surprises.</li>
              <li>I have not preceded each recipe with the standard "Preheat the oven to..." but please remember to have the oven heating while you are putting a recipe together.</li>
              <li>Quotes in a recipe are those of its author unless otherwise indicated</li>
              <li>Crock-pot is the registered name of a slow cooker but I am using the word generically.</li>
              <li>I do realize all those 10 ounce canes of soup are really 10.75, but who wants to write all that!</li>
              <li>Butter and margarine are used interchangeably unless otherwise noted.</li>
              <li>I have tried to mention the size of the can or package or box in order to reduce confusion. However, that has not always been possible.</li>
              <li>Remember Folks, this is a family cookbook. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a diet book! There are no statistics for calories, fat grams, and cholesterol content. Not exactly a nutritionist's dream. It's home cooking, food we love to eat, good tastes. So, kick back and enjoy!</li>
